# RibosOme Stalling Estimator (ROSE)

Guidance:

1. Install scikit-learn (http://scikit-learn.org/) and caffe (http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/) first.

2. Edit file paths (e.g., homepath) in the scripts based on your settings.

3. Put your test data in the corresponding folder.

4. Note that the codes and data released here are only for the demo use, and a user-friendly version of our ROSE software is coming soon.

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me :)
